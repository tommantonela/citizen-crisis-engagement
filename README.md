Communication strategies are important during crises, as they can influence people's behaviours, increase awareness, and provide them with information to satisfy their needs, among other effects. Several theories have shed light on the stages of crises, how information needs vary over time, and the different dimensions involved in human communications, particularly when using social media. In this context, the COVID-19 crisis has posed challenges to society, governments, and public order, forcing us to rethink how to interact within society. 

We study the linguistic style and the pragmatic meaning of communications by adapting an existing dimension model and linking them to crisis stages and uncertainty reduction goals. In particular, we analyze a data collection from local governments in Argentina. We performed a causal inference analysis to determine how those patterns contributed to citizen engagement. Our findings show that local governments reflected particular patterns of social dimensions of in their communication in their communication strategies across the COVID-19 crisis, matching somehow the expected crisis-related stages from the chosen theories. From a more general perspective, we believe that the insights of this work could help government officials to design, monitor, and adjust their communication strategies to achieve a more efficient information diffusion to citizens.

The study is based on [GobBsAsTweets: Twitter Dataset of Local Governments in Buenos Aires (Argentina)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3fszgrvm2r) a collection of tweets collected from Buenos Aires municipalities (Argentina):
